              In 2018, I decided to bring a little extra "Mimi" magic into my life by adopting him from a shelter in Pennsylvania.
              This tuxedo gentleman is the real head of household even though I pay for all the bills.
              Then in 2019, along came Bran, a typical organge cat who's never got his turn of using the one brain cell which is commonly known to be shared among all orange cats, 
              completing my dynamic duo of <strong>"very good bois"</strong>. We've been attached at the hip ever since, much like Velcro but with much more fur you'd ever expected. 
              Together, we embarked on the grand adventure of moving from Pennsylvania to the golden land of California, 
              where Bran's adventures in beachcombing began (just kidding, he's def more of an indoor explorer and does NOT have the brain cell to survive outside). 
              Oh, and yes, you heard it right‚ÄîI'm in the process of crafting an entire webpage dedicated to a glamorous collection of cat pics (well who wouldn't want to see that?!?!). 
              Each feline model will have their very own dazzling bio because, 
              let's face it, these furballs are basically celebrities in disguise. 
              Stay tuned for the purr-fect profiles, coming soon to a browser near ya!

              You see, we all need a little escape from reality, right? While some folks unwind by counting sheep, I prefer to dive headfirst into the whimsical worlds of art and music, because, well, who needs sleep anyway?
              As one of my many "About Me" identities will tell you, I'm a bona fide classical music aficionado who tinkled the ivories on the piano in my youth. 
              My most prized non-living possession, apart from my health insurance, is a Kawaii digital piano that I splurged on as a self-congratulatory gift for quitting my last job. It's like my personal confetti cannon of achievement!
              Now, I may not quite practice 40 hours a day (and if you get that joke, you're my kind of person because we love the same specific Youtube channel), 
              but I've got a knack for keeping busy. When I'm not plinking away at the piano, I'm throwing punches in the boxing ring, defying gravity on bouldering walls 
              (though I'm more of a "climb when my bossy friends insist" type), and tearing up the dance floor as the salsa sensation that I am (not exactly, I'm still learning). 
              Oh, and did I mention I'm a former a cappella maestro from my college days? I guess you could say I'm a one-person circus with a side of musical mayhem! üéπü•äüßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüï∫ü©∞üé∂
